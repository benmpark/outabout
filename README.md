An Interactive Website to Find a Good Time to Get Outside

## Overview

This project is currently under construction (but progress is here!). The idea is to have a website where you can put in your location and availability (i.e., which times of day you can get outside for a run, walk, hike, etc.) along with preferences for your ideal condition (temperature, humidity, and so forth).

### Current State

I'm wrapping up the initial version of the front end of the site, where the structure and style of the page is more or less finished, and most of the interactivity (sliders responding, etc.) is in place. The site can now accept text from the user and find a location or (with the user's permission) detect the location automatically.

### Next Steps

- Create the function that will take the data and find the best time (based on preferences, availability) to get out and about (or 'outabout')\
- Tidy up the layout.
- Time zone support (detect via browser, but also update based on location)
