An Interactive Website to Find a Good Time to Get Outside

## Overview
This project is currently under construction. The idea is to have a website where you can put in your location and availability (i.e., which times of day you can get outside for a run, walk, hike, etc.) along with preferences for your ideal condition (temperature, humidity, and so forth).

### Current State
I'm wrapping up the initial version of the front end of the site, where the structure and style of the page is more or less finished, and most of the interactivity (sliders responding, etc.) is in place. There are placeholders for now where the data from external sources will ultimately be plugged in.

### Next Steps
- Add a form for putting in the current location
- Create the function that will take the data and find the best time (based on preferences, availability) to get out and about (or 'outabout')
- Set up API to actually get the live weather data and forecast
